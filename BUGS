Please post bugs to:

    https://github.com/OPENNETWORKINGLAB/flowvisor/issues

Any bug report is appreciated but the best bug reports include:

1) if and how the bug can be replicated
2) a stack trace (if available)
3) tcpdump's of both the switch<-->FV and FV<-->controllers 
	openflow control channels
        - make sure to set the capture length to 0 meaning
        capture the full packets.  Traces with partial packet captures
        as not useful :-(

Thanks in advance!
